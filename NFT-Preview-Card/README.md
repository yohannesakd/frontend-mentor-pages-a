## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a relatively simple project with not a lot of content to display, it took me about 1:30hr which is way more than it should have been so i can see that i need to work faster.
I learned a bit more about box-shadow and background images.

### Continued development

I can definetely see that i need to work on understanding designs and painting the picture of the structure in my head.
